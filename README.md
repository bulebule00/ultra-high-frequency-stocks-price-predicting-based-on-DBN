This paper discusses the definition and characteristics of high-frequency finance data firstly. We find that the intensity of the transaction, that is, the duration of the transaction shows a U pattern and the daily cycle. The high-peak and heavy-tail phenomenon is found in empirical distribution of high frequency finance data and the change of trading price is focused. These characteristics lead to the traditional time series models have poor performance on accuracy of forecasting.

In order to forecast the high-frequency share price more precisely, this paper uses the deep learning models which can better extract the data features of high-frequency share price to predict. The history, theoretical basis and model classification of deep learning are introduced in detail in this paper. The center of the paper focuses on structure of Restricted Boltzmann Machine, maximum likelihood learning strategy and the approximate gradient of likelihood function based on Gibbs sampling and contrastive divergence learning. In the selection of the index to predict the high-frequency stock price, this paper has reference to the existing literatures, and chooses first four historical stock prices. With increasing time prediction and deep belief network model prediction accuracy has almost no change, and the prediction precision of the other two models showing a downward trend. It also illustrates the deep learning model can in some extent avoid the overfitting phenomenon.
This paper constructs a deep confidence network with three layers finally. We find that the model can fit the price trend of high-frequency finance. At the same time, we compare the forecasting ability of deep belief networks, neural networks and ARMA in 10, 20 and 30 minutes. With increasing prediction interval, the forecasting accuracy of deep belief network has almost no change, and the prediction precision of the other two models showing a downward trend. It also illustrates the deep learning model can in some extent avoid the over-fitting phenomenon.

# 摘要
首先，本文对高频金融的定义、特征行了论述。在实证分析中，发现了高频交易强度，即交易持续期呈现出U型模式和日周期，高频金融数据多是尖峰厚尾而非正态分布，并且价格变化较为集中。以上特征导致传统的时序模型在预测精度上往往表现不佳。
 为了提高高频股价的预测精度，本文采用能够更好提取数据特征的深度学习模型对高频股价数据进行建模预测。本文详细介绍了深度学习的历史、理论依据和模型分类，重点介绍了受限玻尔兹曼机的结构、极大似然学习策略和近似求解似然函数梯度的Gibbs抽样和对比差异算法。在选取预测高频股价的指标上，本文参考已有文献，最终选取前四期的历史股价。
   最后本文构建一个三层结构的深度置信网络模型。本文发现基于历史股票价格的深度置信网络模型能够很好的拟合价格走势，同时比较了深度置信网络与神经网络、ARMA模型在10、20和30分钟内的预测能力。随着预测时间的增加，深度置信网络模型预测精度几乎无变化，而另外两个模型的预测精度呈现出下降趋势，这也说明了深度学习模型能够在一定程度上避免过拟合现象。
